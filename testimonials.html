<p>Kathy has forged me into the athlete that I am today, in every way and I attribute all of the success I have had to her coaching. Kathy has always believed in my dreams and worked in concrete creative ways to help me realize them. She works with her athletes mind, body and heart as the full unique people they are. As a younger athlete Kathy was instrumental in guiding my early success in a healthy way making sure that I had and have a long career injury free.
After running for Western Colorado University Kathy started coaching me again post college. In the short span of 4 years Kathy took me to realizing my dream of becoming an international competitor and competing with the best in the most competitive trail running circuits in the world.
Kathy has coached me through my first successful completion of the Golden Trail World Series. In this series she has coached me to two consecutive top American finishes in the infamous Marathon du Mont Blanc in Chamonix France and a 3rd American finish in the infamous Sierre- Zinal Trail race (also part of the Valsir Mountain World Cup). She has also coached me to a road marathon PR of 2:26.</p>
<p>Among all of these things Kathy has supported my growth and development in all areas of my life. She has supported me in becoming a better athlete by following my heart and becoming a better person as well. For example she is as present as a coach to me in Boulder Colorado as she is while I am pursuing my advanced masters in law overseas in Geneva Switzerland. In every sense I owe all of my accomplishments as an athlete to Kathy and her deep kindness and
fun attitude to the sport I love and all of her athletes.

<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49548549881_efc11ca19b_o.jpg" alt="" /></span>Two years ago, I transitioned to my coach, my confidante, my friend: Kathy Butler, … I realized she was everything I needed in a coach. Not only has she shaped me to be a better athlete and friend, but to achieve more than I thought possible in running. There are times that she pushes me to do the extra rep and then there are times she tells me no more half way through the workout. She pays attention. Not only does she challenge you, but encourages and listens to you. Her workouts and nutrition strategy gave me strength as I went through ups and downs mentally and physically. She knew that I had gone through a tough time outside of training, and life was just getting the better of me, but during workouts and runs, she made me feel wanted. She made me feel as I had a home and the team became family. She made me see that I became stronger and that those moments can be overcome by just taking one step in each rep at a time. …She has guided me to achieve a 1:16 Half Marathon and a 2:45 marathon at California International Marathon in 2017, qualifying for the Olympic Trials. …I know for me she is more than a coach. She is someone who has shown that when I doubt myself, she is my cheerleader, the one person who will believe in you.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49857088828_2c570353df_o.png" alt="" /></span>After 2 years of running, and following all kinds of pre designed coaching programs I wasn't moving forward. I increased my mileage and effort but the PB's where very difficult to improve on. After 5 months with a bespoke program by Coach Kathy I started to get serious, I began to improve and also became more motivated. I'm training for my first marathon and I have no doubt I'll be in good shape. Under Kathy's coaching I have acheived PB's of 41:40 for 10k, and 1:34:58 for the HM .

In the time I trained with Kathy Butler, I gained so much both mentally and physically, that excelled my running abilities to new heights. Providing workouts specific to my goals, I was always confident in the direction my training was headed. In addition to the workouts Kathy provided, she also helped me adjust my mental mentality on racing in a way where I felt confident and ready whenever I hit the starting line for a race. Within six months of training with Kathy, I dropped my best times including a 36:14 10K and a 1:18:45 Half Marathon. She also helped me achieve a dream of mine, which was to run for one the best college cross country teams in the nation! Thanks to the workouts and skills that I gained through Kathy’s training, I was offered a spot on the cross country teams roster. I know when my collegiate career has come to an end, I will return to Kathy for her guidance and experience in training.</p>

Kathy helped me get involved in running and is training me for my first marathon. I started out running a few miles a week on the treadmill at the health club last year. Now, seven miles seems like an easy run. Kathy has been available to help me with all my questions and concerns from when I started as a novice runner last year to getting ready for longer races this fall. She is a great coach and fun to work with.<br></br><br></br><br></br></p>
