<p>I had been trying to break 3 hours in a marathon for a number of years, but couldn't ever quite get there.  After an unsuccessful and frustrating attempt at Grandma's marathon in 2018, and a PR of 3:05, a friend told me I should start working with Kathy and was confident she could help me hit my goal.  I started working with Kathy before the Indianapolis Marathon in 2019, and was able to drop over 10 minutes off of my PR.  Since then, I've run 6 more marathons with Kathy and set PR's in 4 of those (and all when I was over 40 years old).  Overall, she's helped me drop my PR now by over 20 minutes!  I can't speak highly enough of her expertise and the training she's provided.</p>

<p>I started working with Kathy, who came highly recommended and did not disappoint! Her tried and true workout plans, down to earth disposition, and customization of training to fit my life - which includes a full time job, part time job, and other hobbies- makes for a successful combination.</p>

<p>Kathy’s training has been without a doubt the most effective training I have ever had. She is always easy
to get a hold of for last minute adjustments, or rescheduling when you have an odd week. On top of
that, she is very good at taking the workouts the group has, and tailoring them more specifically to the
distance you are training for.</p>

<p>In the short span of 4 years Kathy took me to realizing my dream of becoming an international competitor and competing with the best in the most competitive trail running circuits in the world.
Kathy has coached me through my first successful completion of the Golden Trail World Series. In this series she has coached me to two consecutive top American finishes in the infamous Marathon du Mont Blanc in Chamonix France and a 3rd American finish in the infamous Sierre- Zinal Trail race (also part of the Valsir Mountain World Cup). She has also coached me to a road marathon PR of 2:26.</p> <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/sports/fair-game/cu-creates-scholarship-to-promote-lgbtq-visibility-and-inclusion/73-4414bc1a-c608-49f5-86de-008951373a1d" target="_blank"><b>The Colorado Athletics Visibility Award</b></a>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524223092_b9fb87546f_n.jpg" alt="" /></span>Not only does she challenge you, but encourages and listens to you. Her workouts and nutrition strategy gave me strength as I went through ups and downs mentally and physically. She knew that I had gone through a tough time outside of training, and life was just getting the better of me, but during workouts and runs, she made me feel wanted. She made me feel as I had a home and the team became family. She made me see that I became stronger and that those moments can be overcome by just taking one step in each rep at a time. …She has guided me to achieve a 1:16 Half Marathon and a 2:45 marathon at California International Marathon in 2017, qualifying for the Olympic Trials.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525187635_8ec2ded370_n.jpg" alt="" /></span>After 2 years of running, and following all kinds of pre designed coaching programs I wasn't moving forward. I increased my mileage and effort but the PB's where very difficult to improve on. After 5 months with a bespoke program by Coach Kathy I started to get serious, I began to improve and also became more motivated. I'm training for my first marathon and I have no doubt I'll be in good shape. Under Kathy's coaching I have acheived PB's of 41:40 for 10k, and 1:34:58 for the HM .

In the time I trained with Kathy Butler, I gained so much both mentally and physically, that excelled my running abilities to new heights. Providing workouts specific to my goals, I was always confident in the direction my training was headed. In addition to the workouts Kathy provided, she also helped me adjust my mental mentality on racing in a way where I felt confident and ready whenever I hit the starting line for a race. Within six months of training with Kathy, I dropped my best times including a 36:14 10K and a 1:18:45 Half Marathon. She also helped me achieve a dream of mine, which was to run for one the best college cross country teams in the nation! Thanks to the workouts and skills that I gained through Kathy’s training, I was offered a spot on the cross country teams roster. I know when my collegiate career has come to an end, I will return to Kathy for her guidance and experience in training.</p>

Kathy helped me get involved in running and is training me for my first marathon. I started out running a few miles a week on the treadmill at the health club last year. Now, seven miles seems like an easy run. Kathy has been available to help me with all my questions and concerns from when I started as a novice runner last year to getting ready for longer races this fall. She is a great coach and fun to work with.<br></br><br></br><br></br></p>
